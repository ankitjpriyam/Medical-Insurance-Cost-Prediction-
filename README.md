Developed a Medical Insurance Cost Prediction model using Python, leveraging machine learning algorithms to predict the cost of medical insurance based on various factors such as age, BMI, gender, and smoking habits. The project involved data preprocessing, feature selection, and training regression models to accurately estimate costs. Achieved improved model performance by optimizing hyperparameters and evaluating metrics like R-squared values.
